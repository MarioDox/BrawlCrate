*BrawlBox v0.78 `bboxapi` scripts are partially forwards compatible with `BrawlAPI`. When running them, the program will attempt to properly convert them to the new API. It is still recommended to use scripts originally designed for BrawlCrate for the best results. BrawlBox plugins do not work with the subscription service.
